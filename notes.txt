dropdown for the different saved hotbars

Then a display that shows the 9 hotbar slots, with the name of the presets or Empty, or something to indicate the command block slot, and you should be able to drag to swap these


Main section at the top
========================

Simple section that lets the user choose from the basic MPK options. This would just be a series of dropdowns:
Practice Type: - End Enter, Stronghold Enter, Fortress, Bastion, Nether Enter, Blind, BT, Shipwreck, Monument
Gamemode: - Creative, Survival, Adventure, Spectator
Difficulty:


Main section - Inventory view (Fixed Slot Items)
=================================================

A view of a Minecraft inventory + hotbar incl offhand and armor slots.

Each slot renders the baseline item icon if there is only one item in that slot. If there are 2/3/4, use a 2x2 sub-grid in each slot to show them all. If there are more than 4,
use the sub grid to show the most likely 3, then a "+X" test in the 4th subgrid slot.

Slots can be dragged around to swap them

Clicking on a slot brings up a popup to edit that slot. This will be a menu where you can select all the items, their probability weights (with calculated percentages
shown from the entered weights), and optionally select "randomiser links". The top of that popup should have a clear all button, and a "use preset" button where you can select from
builtin presets made by me (which mostly act as examples). To edit individual items, you click on the icon (or the slot where the icon goes) and it brings up a top level item
selector popup. There should also be buttons to set the slot as "Force Empty" (as opposed to the default empty state of "Available for random items"

Note, only inventory (not hotbar or offhand) slots would be able to be available for random items. Build this restriction into the GUI.

Note - inventory slots that are set up with fixed item data can't ever have the option to either contain something or be available for random items.
(ie 50% chance to have something specific, 50% chance to be available for random isn't allowed).
(from the perspective of this restriction, being forced empty is treated as if having an item (since force empty involves putting a barrier there)


Main Section - Randomised Position Item Sets
============================================

Would display as a list of page-wide segments. Each contains a horizontal list of item displays, separated by text "or". If any given option has too many items, it displays just the
first few then an item slot with "+X". If there are too many options, just display the most likely few then say "and X more sets" at the end.
Each segment also has an editable title. And below the segment list there would be a blank segment where you can click to add a new one. Each segment would say click to edit
somewhere and clicking it would bring up a top level popup.

That popup would have a vertical list of each of the options. Each of the options would have a section on the left that is just item slots where you can select all the items.
Then there'd be a weight for each option, and the randomiser links stuff, and clear all buttons where applicable etc.


Other sections that would exist but don't need from the start:

- Health and saturation
- Fire resistance (or generalised to other status effects?)

Note:

fixedSlotsData.numAvailableForRandomInvSlots() must be greater than randomSlotsData.totalMaxNumStacks()



Randomiser links:

Any given item can EITHER trigger a label, or depend on a/some label(s).
Need to not allow any kind of randomiser links to be set up in a case where there is only one option.
Don't allow exclamation marks in randomiser links...
Important note: If a player puts duplicate entries into any weighted list (ie same option, same randomiser links, could be different weights) then auto combine them into
one option with the summed weights when they close that popup.


Item selector popup
=====================

Can start with a simple search thing. But ideal menu would have multiple tabs. A search tab where you can access any item, then some tabs with common items nicely organised
(eg piglin barters tab, tools/weapons tab).
