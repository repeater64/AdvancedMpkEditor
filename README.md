# Advanced MPK Editor

Website: [repeater64.github.io/AdvancedMpkEditor](https://repeater64.github.io/AdvancedMpkEditor/)

This is a website that lets you create saved hotbars for use with [MiniPracticeKit](https://github.com/Knawk/mc-MiniPracticeKit) (MPK).

It provides an easy-to-use interface, but allows very high levels of customisation that could only normally be done with MPK by spending hours writing commands inside of books.

If you want to start using MPK for the first time, this website will help you get set up as simply as possible, and allow as much or as little customisation as you want.

If you're experienced with MPK, switching to this editor will let you make your practice splits much more realistic, so they genuinely resemble in-game scenarios.

Detailed instructions on how to use it are provided on the website itself!

## Features

### Helpful for anyone

- Quick and easy way to edit your MPK setup, that doesn't require understanding of MPK trigger items or anything - you just set up how you want your inventory to look, and you're good to go
- Fully configured presets for commonly practiced splits - just open up the example, drag and drop to rearrange the hotbar to your liking
- You can add commonly used items with extra data, like fire resistance potions, soul speed boots/books, looting swords. You can also add MPK command potions like "Force Perch" and "Re-Blind on Surface"

### For advanced customisation

- Randomise everything! For every hotbar/inventory slot you can set up a (weighted) list of possible items to go in there, not just one. Great for varying your food, block count, etc
- Genuinely shuffled inventory - with normal MPK trigger items, you have to choose between items going in random places (white shulker box) and getting different items each time (colored shulker boxes). With this editor you can have both!
- Fill inventory with junk - for mid/endgame splits, you can have empty spots in your inventory filled with random configurable junk items.
- Easily add fire resistance potion effect, and can randomise the duration
- Health + hunger settings - can adjust starting health, hunger and saturation
- Linked randomisers - you can link the results of any one random choice to others. See below for the kind of things this makes possible

### Examples of what can be done with this website

- End fight: Correlate the number of beds in random spots in your inventory to the number of respawn anchors in your hotbar
- End fight: Make your saturation on end enter match the food in your offhand
- Stronghold: Randomise your health and hunger situation, so you sometimes have to hunger reset and sometimes don't
- Blind: Random chance to either to be precrafted or not each time you run it
- Fortress: Either have a fire res potion in your hotbar and no effect, or an empty slot and the fire resistance effect with a range of durations
- Fortress: Randomise your blaze bed/tnt, and only give tnt when your offhand food is rotten flesh, and only give yellow beds if your food is bread
- And much more!

Note that all the above is technically possible with standard MPK, but would involve manually writing a lot of commands into books (in some cases several hundred). The website fully automates this without you needing to think about commands.
