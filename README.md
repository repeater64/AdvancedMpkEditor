### Advanced MPK Editor

Website: [repeater64.github.io/AdvancedMpkEditor](https://repeater64.github.io/AdvancedMpkEditor/)

This is a website that lets you create saved hotbars for use with [MiniPracticeKit](https://github.com/Knawk/mc-MiniPracticeKit) (MPK).

It provides an easy-to-use interface, but allows very high levels of customisation that could only normally be done with MPK by spending hours writing commands inside of books.

Detailed instructions on how to use it are provided on the website itself!
